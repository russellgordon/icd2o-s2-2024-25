## Objective

Roughly reproduce a photograph using the Turtle Sketches enviroment.

## Overview

In this activity, you will work with a partner to:

- analyse an image
- make a short plan
- identify where loops might be used
- identify where functions might be used
## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Installing Playgrounds|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] The [[Subscribe to Turtle Sketches|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Image Analysis*
- [ ]  A partner to engage in the [[Driver-Navigator Pattern|Driver-Navigator]] paired programming model.
## Success criteria
- [ ] your plan identifies simple repeated elements were loops can be used
- [ ] your plan identifies more complex repeated elements where functions might be used
- [ ] your plan includes some point form steps describing how elements might be drawn
- [ ] your finished drawing approximately reproduces the original photograph
- [ ] code includes [[Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently|correctly indented]]

## Reflection prompts
1. What problems did you encounter when completing this task? How did you and your partner resolve them?
2. How did your code differ from code written by another group? Did you learn anything new by comparing your code to someone else's?
## Conclusion

Make a post on [Notion](https://notion.so) to:
- [ ] share the code your group wrote, within a [[Sharing Long Blocks of Code|code block]]
- [ ] share at least one screenshot of your group's work on this task
- [ ] briefly respond to the prompts above
