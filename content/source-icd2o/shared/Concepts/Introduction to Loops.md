If we wanted someone to walk 5 steps toward us, it's easier to say just that – rather than say:

- walk 1 step
- walk 1 step
- walk 1 step
- walk 1 step
- walk 1 step

In the same way, we can use a loop to have a computer repeat an instruction – or a block of multiple instructions – more than once.
## Creating a loop

To make a loop in Swift Playgrounds, just begin typing the keyword `for`, and then press the **Return** key to use autocomplete:

You will then have a template for a loop that you can fill in:

First, fill in the *number*.

That describes how many times you want the block of code to run.

Let's choose 5:

Next, copy the code shown here below into the body of the loop:

```swift
turtle.penDown()
turtle.forward(distance: 50)
turtle.penUp()
turtle.forward(distance: 50)
```

... replacing the placeholder:

... with the code:

The opening `{` marks the start of the code block that will be repeated.

The closing `}` marks the end of the code block that will be repeated.

You can step through your code to see exactly how the loop repeats the block of instructions:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">

	</iframe>
	</div>

> Watch the video a second time. Notice how Playgrounds tells you how often a line of code has been run within a loop – 1x for once, 2x for twice, and so on.
