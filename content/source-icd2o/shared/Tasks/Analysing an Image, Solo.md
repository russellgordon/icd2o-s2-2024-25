## Objective

Mostly independently, make a rough reproduction of a photograph using the Turtle Sketches environment.

## Overview

In this activity, you will work alone to:

- analyse an image
- make a short plan
- identify where loops might be used
- identify where functions might be used
  
## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Installing Playgrounds|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] The [[Subscribe to Turtle Sketches|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Image Analysis*

## Success criteria
- [ ] your plan identifies simple repeated elements were loops can be used
- [ ] your plan identifies more complex repeated elements where functions might be used
- [ ] your plan includes some point form steps describing how elements might be drawn
- [ ] your finished drawing approximately reproduces the original photograph
- [ ] code includes [[Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently|correctly indented]]

## Image

You have selected an image to reproduce, after consultation with Mr. Jones or Mr. Gordon. This was provided to you as a hardcopy printout.

## Reflection prompts

1. What problems did you encounter when completing this task? How did you resolve them?
2. How often did you find yourself referring to your plan while authoring your code?
   
## Conclusion

Make a post on [Notion](https://notion.so) to:
- [ ] share the code you wrote, within a [[Sharing Long Blocks of Code|code block]]
- [ ] share at least one screenshot of your work on this task
- [ ] briefly respond to the prompts above
